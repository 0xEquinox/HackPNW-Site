        We are a group of high school students from the Seattle area who were
        frustrated by the lack of high school level programming events in our
        area, so we created our own! Our goal with HackPNW is to bring together
        students to form cross-campus connections, learn from each other, and
        build on each others' skillsets with real world experience.
